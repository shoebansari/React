1-React is javascript library developed by Facebook in 2011.
  React is used to build single page applications.
  React follows component based approach which helps in building reusable UI Components.
  It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.

2-Features Of React
It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real Dom
It uses server side rendering and client side rendering but bydefault it is client side rendering
It follows unidirectional data flow or data binding.

3-Differences between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.
Real Dom                                  Virual Dom
It updates slow.                          It updates fast
Can Directly update Html                  Can't directly update html
Created new Dom if element updates        update the JSX if element updates
Dom manipulation is very expensive        Dom manipulation is very easy
Too much of memory wastage                No memory wastage.

4-Advantage of React
It increases the application performance
It can be conviniently used on client as well as server side
Because of JSX code readability increases
React is easy to integrate with other frameworks like Meteor, angular. etc
UI test cases become extremely easy.

5-What is the limitation of React
React is just a library not full-blown framework
Library is very large and takes time to understand.
Coding gets complex as it uses Inline templating and JSX.

6-What is JSX
Shorthand of javascript and XML.This is the type of the file used by React Which utilizes the expresiveness of javascript along with html
like template syntax.This makes the HTML file really easy to understand.

7-What Do you understand by Virtual DOM. How it works.
React creates copy of 2 Virtual Dom If there is any change happens it will match to other Virtual DOM Then will update the Real DOM.
This makes react very fast.(youtube.com/watch?v=M-Aw4p0pWwg)

8-Why can't browsers read JSX.
Browser can only read javascript objects but JSX is not regular javascript object.Thus to enable a browser to read jsx, first we need to 
transform JSX file into javascript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.

9-How React different from angular
Topic             React                     Angular
Architecture      Only the View Of MVC      Complete MVC
rendering         Server side rendering     Client side rendering
Dom               Uses virtual DOM          Uses Real DOM
Data binding      One-way data binding      two way data binding
Debugging         Compile time debugging    Runtime debugging

10-In React, Everyting is component.Explain.
Components are building block of React application's UI.These components splits up entire UI into small and independent reusable 
pieces.Then it renders each of these components independent of each other without affecting the rest of the UI.

Component are 2 Types

Class component
    A class component must include the extends React.component statement. this statement creates an inheritance to React.component, and 
    gives your component access to React.component's functions.

Function Component
    A function component also returns Html, and behaves much the same way as class component, but function component can be written using much
    less code, are easier to understand.
