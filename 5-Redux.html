//Redux is a predictable state container for javascript app.As the application grows, it become difficult to keep it organized
and  maintain data flow. Redux solve the problem by managing the application's state with the single global object called store.

Principles of redux.

1-Single source of truth
The state of your whole application is stored in a object tree within a single store.

2-State is read only
The only way to change the state is to emit the action, an object describing what happened. this means nobody can directly change
the state of your application.

//Redux installation 
1-npm install --save redux
2-npm install --save react-redux

Lets learn about how redux works.

Lets assumes our application's state is described by a plain object called initialState which is as follows

const initialState={
  isLoading:false,
  item:[],
  hasError:false,
}

Every piece of the code in your application cannot change this state.To change the state you need to dispatch the action.

What is action now?

An action is a plain object that describe the intention to cause the change with a type property.It must have a type 
property which tells what type of action is being performed.The command for action is as follows

return {
  type:'ITEM_REQUEST' //type
  isLoading:true      //payload
}


What is Reducer?

Action and state are held togther by a function called reducers.An action is dispathed with an intention to cause the change.
This change is performed by the reducer.Reducer is only way to change the state in redux, making it more predictable, centralised
and debuggable.

const reducer = (state=initialState, action)=>{
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ITEM_REQUEST':
      return Object.assign({}, state, {isLoading;action.isLoading})
    default:
      return state
  }
}

Redux has single store which holds the application state.if you want to split your code on the basis of data handling logic,
you should start spliting your reducers instead of store in Redux.

What is Store?

Store is immutable object tree in Redux.A store is state container Which holds the application's state. Redux can only have single
store in your application.Whenever store is created in redux, your need to specify the reducers.Here is how we create store

import { createStore } from 'redux'
import reducer from './reducers/reducer'
const store = createStore(reducer);

getState()
It helps you retrieve the current state of your Redux store
store.getState();

What is differences between Redux Thunk and Redux Saga?
Both Redux Thunk and Redux Saga take care of dealing with side effects. In very simple terms, applied to the most 
common scenario (async functions, specifically AJAX calls) Thunk allows Promises" to deal with them, Saga uses Generators. 
Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, Saga/Generators are more powerful but you will need
to learn them. When Promises are just good enough, so is Thunk, when you deal with more complex cases on a regular basis, 
Saga gives you better tools.
