11-What is the purpose of render() in react.
Each react component must have render() mandatorily. It returns a single react element which is representation of native DOM component.
If more than one then must be grouped together inside a <div>,<group>,  or <form>.
  
12-What is Props?
Props is shorthand for properties in React.They are read-only components which must be kept pure i.e immutable. They always pass down from parent
to child component throughout the application. A child component can never send back prop to its parent component. This help maintaining the
unidirection the data flow and are generally used to render the dynamically generated data.

13-What is State?
States are heart of the react component. States are source of the data must be kept as simple as possible. Basically States are the object
which determine component rendering and behaviour.They are mutable unlike the props and creates dynamic and interactive component.
They are accessed by this.state().

14-Life cycle method of React.
componentWillMount()->Executed just before rendering takes place on client as well as server side.
componentDidMount()->Executed on the client side only after first render.
componentWillReceiveProps()->Invoked as soon as the props are received from the parent class and before another render is called.
shouldComponentUpdate()->Returns true as false value based on certain conditions.if you want your component to update, return true else return false.
componentWillUpdate()->Called just before rendering takes place in The DOM.
componentDidUpdate()->Called immediately after rendering takes place.
componentWllUnmount()->Called after the component is unmounted from the DOM.used to clear up the memory.


15-Higher Order Component(HOC)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtSzJn41LgM
higher order component is like same as higher order function
It takes a component as a props and return a component.

17-Pure component
React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is React.Component doesn't implement shouldComponentUpdate,
but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow  prop and state comparison.
If React component's render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent for 
a performance boosts.

18-Lazy Loading
splitting is used to split code by using lazy loading in react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV9gvls8IP8
instead of loading all the data at same time better to load only relevent data. 
When page is showing loading other peice of code already loaded that is known as lazy loading.

import {lazy} from 'react'
import myComp = lazy(()=> import('./component/myCom')) 

render(
  <div>Another component</div>
  <suspense fallback={<div>..loading</div>}>
    <myComp/>
  </suspense>
)

When rendering it will show 
AnotherComponent then ...loading then myComp.


19-Tree Shaking
Tree shaking is a process that bundlers like webpack and rollup go through to remove unused code.
Tree shaking means that only components from our library used in the app are included in the app bundle. 
If not tree shaken, all the components will be included even if they are not used. So, tree shaking reduces 
the size of the app bundle and increases the app’s performance because less time is spent downloading,
decompressing, parsing, and executing it.

21-props drilling, context api, useContext
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us4pQzWRznQ

useContext hook makes it easy to pass data throughout your app without manually passing props down the tree.

ContextAPI
has 3 things to pass the data
context 
provided
useContext

import {createContext} from 'react'

const BioData = createContext()

return(
    <BioData.Provider value={"shoeb"}>
        <comB></comB>
    </BioData.Provider>
)

export {BioData}

Now BioData can be accessed from Any component

In comB

import {useContext} from 'react'
import {BioData} from './ComA'

const context = useContext(BioData)

console.log(context)  //output shoeb

22-CLIENT SIDE RENDERING(CSR) AND SERVER SIDE RENDERING(SSR)

CSR- websites are loaded 3 files from server HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT file
all are send seprately to the browser, 1st HTML file then Css file and javascript file takes time to load on browser
depends upon the size of javascript file. like reactjs and vue js.

SSR-before sending all three file it, server prerenders it on the server with all HTML,CSS,Javascript data inside 
full flidged html documents to desplay the website. example next.js 

React works in both the way client side as well server side but bydefault it works as client side rendering

For server side rendering it needs few changes like
use Hydrate instead of render in index file


23-Explain Strict Mode in React.
Strict mode is tool for highlighting potential problem(like depricated lifecycle method, or legacy classes) in an application,
shows warning to those in console
depricated methods like
componentWillMount->UNSAFE_componentWillMount,
componentWillReceiveProps->UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps,
componentWillUpdate->UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate,
It is used in index.js file as below

ReactDOM.render(
<React.StrictMode>
  <App/>
</React.StrictMode>
)

25- What are the different ways to style a React component?
1-inline->use camelcase if 2 words like in html page background-color but in react backgroundColor
<!-- <h1 style={{color:"red", backgroundColor:"green"}}>SHOEB</h1> -->
2-use const for style.

const style = {
  color:'red',
  backgroundColor:'blue'
}
<!-- <h1 style={style}>SHOEB</h1> -->

3-using in index.css file
then import that file to reflect.

27-What are events or synthetic events in React?
in react events are same as the html events, onclick(HTML) and onClick(React) are same 
but react events are wrapped with the cross-browser wrapper so that on diffrent browser events could be handled.

Other words
Synthetic events are the objects which act as a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event.
It's API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation()and preventDefault() except the events work 
identically across all browsers.
They combine the behavior of different browsers into one API. This is done to make sure that the events show consistent properties
across different browsers.

28-What is Lifting State Up in React?
To pass state from one component to another component as a prop is knwon as lifting state up.

29-What are stateless and stateful components?
In React, a stateful component is a component that holds some state. Stateless components, by contrast, have no state.
Note that both types of components can use props


31-Can you force a component to re-render without calling setState?
In class components, you can call this.forceUpdate() to force a rerender
in functional component, Using react hooks, you can now call useState() in your function component.

31-How can you embed two or more components into one?
React allows us to render one component inside another component. It means, we can create the parent-child relationship between
the 2 or more component

32-What is an event in React?
React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

In HTML

<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>

In React 

<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>


Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.
For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:
In HTML

<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

In React, this could instead be

function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
Here, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don’t need to worry about 
cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events.

When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. 
Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

33- How do you modularize code in React?
React code can easily be modularized by using the component structure. The approach is to define each component into different 
files. With each component separated into different files, all we have to do is figure out how to access the code defined in 
one file within another file. To access one file into another file, React provide the functionality to import and export the 
files.

34-What is the significance of keys in React?
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used to React 
to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an 
identity to the elements in the lists.

35-createEntityAdapter
Simplifies the management of a normalized state of entities, providing efficient methods and 
selectors for manipulating the data.

36-Web Vitals (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAXfn50jEAw)
It is used to improve the performance of appication(It is automated generated and added in src folder and used in index.js file)

getCLS->Cumulative layout shift(CLS)-During the page load some elements moves from left to right or bottom to top or any direction
that measures time for moving elements

getFID->(First Input Delay), How much time it takes after any clicke.

getLCP->(Largest Contentful Paint), 2.5 sec 75%, means 75% of page should load within 2.5 sec, else web site is taking more time than expectation.

getTTFB(time to first byte)->server respond to a request with the first byte of html

All can be seen by using reportWebVitals(console.log); will show the result in browser's consolex
